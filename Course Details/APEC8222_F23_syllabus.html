<p>Challenges, techniques, and opportunities presented by data that has one or more of the following characteristics: large, unstructured, high frequency, variable quality. The course will consist of three parts: 1) computational tools for applying standard econometric techniques on large datasets, 2) working with new types of data, such as unstructured data (e.g.&nbsp;images, text) and web-scraped data, and 3) application of machine learning, AI and other new statistical learning techniques (e.g.&nbsp;classifiers, regression trees, machine learning, neural nets). This course is intended to be a broad introduction to many domains of knowledge with the goal of orienting students towards where they could learn more detailed information relevant to their research.</p>

<section id="objectives" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="objectives">Objectives</h2>
<p>You should leave this course with an understanding of and ability to estimate standard econometric models on large datasets, produce datasets for analysis from unstructured data, and apply several statistical learning techniques to answer economic questions. In particular, you will be able to</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Estimate standard econometric models on datasets containing millions of records</p></li>
<li><p>Understand cross-validation approaches</p></li>
<li><p>Assess the strengths and weaknesses of statistical learning techniques and evaluate their applicability to questions of causal inference.</p></li>
<li><p>Gain competency on new machine learning models</p></li>
<li><p>Achieve moderate skill level of Python programming</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="evaluation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>
<p>Assignments: 70%</p>
<p>Independent Project: 20%</p>
<p>Class Participation: 10%</p>
<p>There will be six assignments during the course, which will consist of programming tasks designed to give you experience working with big and otherwise challenging data in the context of econometric analysis. We plan that you will have at least a week to complete them. You will submit Python-based Jupyter notebooks with your results and analysis, structured so that it can be run without modification. Assignments will be evaluated based on both functionality and the readability/organization of the code that you write. Please read the course policies below on collaboration and working together.</p>
<p>The independent project will be introduced in the middle of the semester and due near the end of the semseter. You will submit a short (3-7 page) writeup, along with the code used. You will also give a short (5 minute) presentation on your results.</p>
<p>If you show up to class every day ready to learn with your computer setup with the day’s tools, you will likely get full class participation points.</p>
<p><u>Late Policy</u>: All assignments must be submitted on Canvas. Late assignments will be accepted for up to three days afterward. For each day late your grade will automatically reduce by 10% (for a maximum reduction of 30%).</p>
<p>There will be no opportunities for extra credit.</p>
<p>If you think that any grading was done incorrectly or unfairly, please come to my office hours. I am happy to revisit the grading, but will re-grade the entire assignment. The purpose of that policy is to be as fair as possible: if one problem needs re-grading, they probably all should have a second look.</p>
<p>Please see the UMN policy below on make-up work and policies concerning legitimate absences. In short, if a legitimate reason prohibits you from finishing an assignment on time, please let me know and we will make accommodations for you.</p>
</section>
<section id="software" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="software"><strong>Software</strong></h2>
<p>We will using the Python programming language (though there will be frequent reference to equivalent R functions). All software in the class is open source and freely available.</p>
<p>For Python, we will work through installation of the programming language and several supporting tools. This course strongly recommends that you bring your own laptop because having a well-setup laptop will serve you well into your academic career. It is not strictly required, but you will likely want to have administrator rights to your computer in order to install all of the supporting software. If you are using a personal computer, this should not be an issue. If you are using a university-owned computer, it might be. Reach out to me ASAP if you have questions about this. If you are not able to bring a suitable computer, please contact the instructors within the first week of class and we can discuss alternatives.&nbsp; It is possible to use a PC, Mac or Linux for this course, though all examples will be given on a PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Becoming skilled in Big Data is partly about mastering the tools and it will be your responsibility to come to class with your computer setup in a way for you to succeed. We will discuss any setup steps necessary in the lecture before it is to be used.</p>
<p><strong>Approximate Course Schedule</strong></p>
<p>I will take more or less time on the topics as needed and will react to student feedback and requests.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="course-policies"><strong>Course Policies</strong></h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><u>Class attendance is expected.</u>&nbsp; You will not be graded on attendance, but we expect you to come: any material covered in class is fair game on assignments and exams. Equally importantly, the questions you and your peers ask and the comments you make during class will make for a better experience for everyone, so please make every effort to attend. That said, unexpected conflicts come up for all of us, so any lecture notes and slides used during class will be available online.</li>
</ol>
<!-- -->
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><u>You may discuss and work on assignments with other students, but you must write up and turn in your own assignment.</u>You all have different strengths and can learn from one another by working together, so we encourage you to do so. The point of this policy is so that you can learn more, not less, so please don’t abuse the privilege and let someone else do the work and you simply copy their answer. That won’t help you learn the material.</li>
</ol>
<!-- -->
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p><u>Do not violate the Student Conduct Code.</u> The assignments you turn in and your answers on exams should reflect your own work. Simply copying someone else’s work, or otherwise violating the Student Conduct Code</p>
<p>(<a href="http://regents.umn.edu/sites/default/files/policies/Student_Conduct_Code.pdf" class="uri">http://regents.umn.edu/sites/default/files/policies/Student_Conduct_Code.pdf</a>) may result in a failing grade and/or additional University action. That may sound scary, and it’s supposed to be, but know that if you turn in work that is your own, you have nothing to worry about. If you have any questions or concerns about this policy, please don’t hesitate to ask.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Treat your classmates with respect.</u> Everyone in the class is here to learn and has an equal right to be treated with respect. This means many things, but in summary, We will not tolerate any form of discrimination or sexual harassment. The University has official policies that you can read if you aren’t sure what constitutes either of those things, but your common sense will take you a long way.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Other notes:</strong></p>
<p>If you require disability accommodations, please let me know at your earliest convenience and we will work together to arrange accommodations. If you have or think you may have a disability and have not yet contacted Disability Services (DS), please do so at 612-626-1333 to arrange for a confidential consultation.</p>

<section id="scholastic-dishonesty" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="scholastic-dishonesty"><strong>Scholastic Dishonesty:</strong></h3>
<p>You are expected to do your own academic work and cite sources as necessary. Failing to do so is scholastic dishonesty. Scholastic dishonesty means plagiarizing; cheating on assignments or examinations; engaging in unauthorized collaboration on academic work; taking, acquiring, or using test materials without faculty permission; submitting false or incomplete records of academic achievement; acting alone or in cooperation with another to falsify records or to obtain dishonestly grades, honors, awards, or professional endorsement; altering, forging, or misusing a University academic record; or fabricating or falsifying data, research procedures, or data analysis. (Student Conduct Code:<a href="http://regents.umn.edu/sites/default/files/policies/Student_Conduct_Code.pdf"><em>http://regents.umn.edu/sites/default/files/policies/Student_Conduct_Code.pdf</em></a>) If it is determined that a student has cheated, he or she may be given an “F” or an “N” for the course, and may face additional sanctions from the University. For additional information, please see:<a href="http://policy.umn.edu/education/instructorresp"><em>http://policy.umn.edu/Policies/Education/Education/INSTRUCTORRESP.html</em></a>.</p>

<section id="academic-freedom-and-responsibility" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="academic-freedom-and-responsibility"><strong>Academic Freedom and Responsibility</strong></h3>
<p>Academic freedom is a cornerstone of the University. Within the scope and content of the course as defined by the instructor, it includes the freedom to discuss relevant matters in the classroom. Along with this freedom comes responsibility. Students are encouraged to develop the capacity for critical judgment and to engage in a sustained and independent search for truth. Students are free to take reasoned exception to the views offered in any course of study and to reserve judgment about matters of opinion, but they are responsible for learning the content of any course of study for which they are enrolled.*</p>
<p>Reports of concerns about academic freedom are taken seriously, and there are individuals and offices available for help. Contact the instructor, the Department Chair, your adviser, the associate dean of the college, or the Vice Provost for Faculty and Academic Affairs in the Office of the Provost.</p>
